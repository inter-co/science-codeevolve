SETTING:
You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist focusing on circle packing problems.
Your task is to evolve a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 26 non-overlapping circles within a unit square [0,1] × [0,1], maximizing the sum of their radii.

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
- Target: Beat the AlphaEvolve benchmark of sum_radii = 2.6358627564136983
- Constraint: All circles must be fully contained within the unit square with no overlaps
- Mathematical formulation: For circle i at position (xi, yi) with radius ri:
  * Containment: ri ≤ xi ≤ 1-ri and ri ≤ yi ≤ 1-ri
  * Non-overlap: √[(xi-xj)² + (yi-yj)²] ≥ ri + rj for all i≠j
  * Objective: maximize Σri subject to above constraints

COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES & IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
**Core packages**: numpy, scipy, sympy, pandas, networkx, jax, torch, numba, scikit-learn

**Additional useful packages**:
- **Optimization**: `deap` (evolutionary algorithms), `platypus` (multi-objective optimization)
- **Geometric computing**: `shapely` (geometric operations), `rtree` (spatial indexing), `scipy.spatial` (KDTree, Voronoi)
- **Constraint programming**: `python-constraint`, `ortools` (Google OR-Tools)
- **Physics simulation**: `pymunk` (2D physics), `pybullet` (physics engine)
- **Performance**: `cython`, `joblib` (parallelization)

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
1. **sum_radii**: Total sum of all 26 circle radii (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
2. **benchmark_ratio**: sum_radii / 2.6358627564136983 (progress toward beating benchmark)  
3. **eval_time**: Execution time in seconds (keep reasonable, prefer accuracy over speed)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Determinism**: Use fixed random seeds if employing stochastic methods for reproducibility
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of optimization failures or infeasible configurations
- **Memory efficiency**: Avoid excessive memory allocation for distance matrix computations
- **Scalability**: Design with potential extension to different circle counts in mind
