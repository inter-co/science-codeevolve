Your task is to evolve a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 16 points in 2D space, maximizing the ratio of minimum distance to maximum distance between all point pairs.

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
- Target: Beat the AlphaEvolve benchmark of min/max ratio = 1/√12.889266112 ≈ 0.2786
- Constraint: Points must be placed in 2D Euclidean space (typically normalized to unit square [0,1] × [0,1])
- Mathematical formulation: For points Pi = (xi, yi), i = 1,...,16:
  * Distance matrix: dij = √[(xi-xj)² + (yi-yj)²] for all i≠j

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES TO CONSIDER:
To achieve the benchmark and balance efficiency, prioritize robust global optimization methods and smart, diverse initialization.
- **Symmetry exploitation**: Leverage rotational and reflectional symmetries of optimal configurations. For N=16, the optimal solution is complex and may not align with simple D4 or D8 symmetries.
- **Diverse Initialization**: Crucial for escaping local optima. Consider quasi-random sequences (Sobol, Halton) or Latin Hypercube Sampling for initial populations to cover the search space broadly.
- **Hybrid Global-Local Approaches**:
  * **Differential Evolution (DE)**: A strong baseline for global search. Combine with highly diverse initial populations (e.g., generated with `init='latinhypercube'` or custom quasi-random methods). Tune `popsize` and `maxiter` carefully for efficiency and effectiveness.
  * **Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)**: Highly effective for continuous, non-convex problems. Often finds better optima with fewer function evaluations than DE, making it suitable for complex landscapes and potentially faster convergence.
  * **Basin-hopping**: Excellent for escaping local optima. Can be used as a post-processing step after a global search (like DE or CMA-ES) or with multiple restarts from different initializations.
  * **Multi-start Optimization**: Run the chosen optimizer multiple times from diverse initializations, selecting the best result. This is a robust way to increase the chance of finding the global optimum, but requires careful management of computational budget.
- **Gradient-free methods**: 
  * Nelder-Mead simplex for robust local search
  * Powell's method for coordinate descent
  * COBYLA for constrained optimization without gradients
- **Geometric heuristics**:
  * Maximin designs from experimental design theory
  * Voronoi-based adaptive placement
  * Force-directed layouts with repulsive interactions
  
GEOMETRIC INSIGHTS & MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS:
- **Packing vs. dispersion duality**: This problem is related to but distinct from circle packing - focuses on point placement rather than area optimization
- **Scale invariance**: Optimal ratio is independent of coordinate system scaling
- **Boundary effects**: Unlike infinite plane problems, finite domains create edge effects that influence optimal configurations
- **Critical configurations for N=16**:
  * For N=16 in a unit square, the optimal configuration is known to be highly non-trivial. It is generally not a perfect 4x4 grid nor a regular 16-gon. It's often described as a distorted square lattice or a configuration exhibiting a complex interplay between boundary and interior points. A simple 4x4 grid should be considered only as a potential *initialization heuristic*, not the target structure.
  * The theoretical upper bound (0.383 for a 16-gon) is for points on a circle, which might not be optimal for a square domain. The AlphaEvolve benchmark of 0.2786 is for the unit square and represents a challenging target.
- **Theoretical bounds**:
  * Upper bound: Perfect regular 16-gon gives ratio = cos(π/16)/√2 ≈ 0.383 (for points arranged on a circle)
  * Lower bound: Random placement typically yields ratios < 0.1
  * AlphaEvolve benchmark: 0.2786 represents significant progress toward theoretical limits for the unit square.
- **Symmetry groups**: Optimal solutions likely respect dihedral symmetries D16, D8, D4, or D2, but the exact configuration for N=16 in a square is complex and might exhibit subtle symmetries.
- **Local vs. global optima**: The high-dimensional landscape with many local optima requires sophisticated global optimization. Finding the true global optimum for N=16 is a known challenge.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
**Recommended implementation patterns:**
- **Distance computation**: 
  * `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist()` for efficient pairwise distances.
  * Vectorized operations using broadcasting for gradient computation (though the objective is non-smooth, this is for general reference).
- **Optimization frameworks**:
  * **Global Search**: Prioritize `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution()` or consider implementing/using `CMA-ES` (e.g., via `cma` package if available or a custom implementation if `scipy` doesn't include it directly). For `differential_evolution`, use `init='latinhypercube'` or `init='sobol'` for initial populations to ensure broad coverage across the search space, rather than just perturbing a single initial guess. This is crucial for finding better global optima.
  * **Local Refinement**: After a global search, `scipy.optimize.minimize()` with methods like 'L-BFGS-B' (if gradients can be approximated) or gradient-free methods like 'Nelder-Mead' or 'Powell' can be used for fine-tuning.
  * **Basin-hopping**: `scipy.optimize.basinhopping()` can be effectively combined with a local minimizer to escape local optima, potentially yielding superior results.
  * Custom objective functions handling min/max ratio computation must be robust to `dmin <= epsilon` (returning `np.inf` or a very large penalty) to prevent division by zero or near-zero.
- **Constraint handling**:
  * Boundary constraints should be handled by the optimizer's `bounds` argument.
- **Advanced techniques**:
  * **Multi-start optimization**: Essential for this problem. Run the primary global optimizer multiple times from *truly diverse* initializations (e.g., different quasi-random seeds or distinct initial population generation methods).
  * **Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)**: Explore this as a powerful alternative or complement to Differential Evolution, especially if DE struggles to converge to high-quality solutions within a reasonable time budget.
  * **Parameter Tuning**: Pay close attention to `popsize`, `maxiter`, and `tol` for any chosen optimizer. For `differential_evolution`, `strategy` can also impact performance. A careful balance of these parameters is crucial for achieving high quality within practical time limits.

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
- **Geometric validation**:
  * Verify exactly 16 distinct points
  * Check coordinate bounds (typically [0,1] × [0,1])
  * Validate distance matrix symmetry and positivity
- **Data validation**:
  * All coordinates must be finite floats
  * No duplicate points (minimum separation threshold)
  * Proper handling of numerical precision issues
- **Solution quality assessment**:
  * Symmetry analysis of final configuration
  * Stability under small perturbations
  * Comparison with known geometric configurations
- **Optimization diagnostics**:
  * Convergence history tracking
  * Gradient norm analysis (when applicable)
  * Multi-run consistency checks
  
PROBLEM-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- **Initialization strategies**:
  * **Crucial for global optima**: For N=16, pure random initialization is unlikely to yield good results.
  * **Recommended**: Quasi-random sequences (Sobol, Halton, Latin Hypercube Sampling) for the initial population of evolutionary algorithms. These offer superior space coverage compared to simple random uniform placement.
  * **Heuristic starters**: Grid-based starting points (e.g., 4x4 for N=16) are good for providing a structured initial guess, but should be combined with significant perturbations or used as one of many diverse starting points, not the sole basis for the entire initial population.
- **Objective function challenges**:
  * Non-smooth function (min/max operations) makes gradient-based methods difficult. Gradient-free global optimizers like DE or CMA-ES are more appropriate.
  * **Many local optima**: Requires robust global search strategies and multi-start approaches to thoroughly explore the landscape.
  * Sensitivity to small coordinate changes: The ratio can change abruptly, making fine-tuning challenging.
- **Constraint geometry**:
  * The unit square domain imposes hard boundaries. Optimizers should rigorously respect these bounds (e.g., using the `bounds` argument in `scipy.optimize` functions).
  * The objective function is `maximize dmin/dmax`, which means the implemented objective function for minimization should be `1.0 / (dmin/dmax)`. Ensure it correctly handles cases where `dmin` is zero or very small (e.g., by returning `np.inf` or a very large penalty) to prevent invalid configurations.
