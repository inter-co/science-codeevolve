SETTING:
You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist focusing on point dispersion problems.
Your task is to evolve a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 16 points in 2D space, maximizing the ratio of minimum distance to maximum distance between all point pairs.

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
- Target: Beat the AlphaEvolve benchmark of min/max ratio = 1/√12.889266112 ≈ 0.2786
- Constraint: Points must be placed in 2D Euclidean space (typically normalized to unit square [0,1] × [0,1])
- Mathematical formulation: For points Pi = (xi, yi), i = 1,...,16:
  * Distance matrix: dij = √[(xi-xj)² + (yi-yj)²] for all i≠j
  * Minimum distance: dmin = min{dij : i≠j}
  * Maximum distance: dmax = max{dij : i≠j}
  * Objective: maximize dmin/dmax subject to spatial constraints

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
1. **min_max_ratio**: dmin/dmax ratio (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
2. **benchmark_ratio**: min_max_ratio / 0.2786 (progress toward beating AlphaEvolve benchmark)
3. **eval_time**: Execution time in seconds (balance accuracy vs. efficiency)

COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES:
**Core packages**: numpy, scipy, sympy, pandas
**Additional useful packages**:
- **3D optimization**: `scipy.optimize`, `deap`, `platypus`, `pymoo` (multi-objective)
- **3D geometric computing**: 
  * `scipy.spatial` (3D distance matrices, ConvexHull, SphericalVoronoi)
  * `trimesh` (3D mesh operations), `open3d` (3D data processing)
- **Specialized 3D algorithms**: 
  * `spherical-geometry` for spherical arrangements

- **Performance**: `numba` (3D JIT compilation), `joblib`

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

# PROMPT-BLOCK-START

Your primary task is to implement the `min_max_dist_dim2_16` function by applying a global optimization algorithm to find the optimal point arrangement.

**Specific Implementation Instructions:**

1.  **Choose a Global Optimizer**: Utilize `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` as it is well-suited for global optimization of non-smooth, bounded problems.
    *   Set `seed=42` for reproducibility.
    *   Consider increasing `maxiter` for better convergence, but balance with `eval_time` constraints. A value like `maxiter=1000` or higher is a good starting point.

2.  **Define the Objective Function**:
    *   Create a helper function, `objective(coords_flat)`, which takes a 1D numpy array `coords_flat` (representing the flattened 2D coordinates of 16 points, i.e., `(16*2,)` shape).
    *   Inside `objective`:
        *   Reshape `coords_flat` into `(16, 2)` points.
        *   Calculate all pairwise Euclidean distances using `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`.
        *   Determine `dmin` (minimum distance) and `dmax` (maximum distance).
        *   Return the *negative* of the `dmin/dmax` ratio, as `differential_evolution` minimizes by default.
        *   **Robustness**: If `dmax` is zero (e.g., all points are identical), return a very large negative number (e.g., `-np.inf`) to heavily penalize such configurations and guide the optimizer away. If `dmin` is zero but `dmax` is not, the ratio will be zero, which is also a poor outcome.

3.  **Define Bounds**:
    *   The points must be within the unit square `[0,1] × [0,1]`. Therefore, define bounds for all 32 coordinates as `(0, 1)`. `differential_evolution` accepts a list of `(min, max)` tuples, one for each coordinate.

4.  **Initial Population (Optional)**: While `differential_evolution` generates its own initial population, the `init` argument can be used to provide better starting points (e.g., a regular grid or perturbed regular polygon) if desired, to potentially speed up convergence. However, for a first attempt, the default random initialization within bounds is often sufficient.

5.  **Return Value**: The `min_max_dist_dim2_16` function should return the optimized `(16, 2)` numpy array of points, which are the `x` attribute of the `OptimizeResult` object, reshaped.

**OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES TO CONSIDER (as background for the chosen method):**
- **Symmetry exploitation**: Leverage rotational and reflectional symmetries of optimal configurations
- **Regular polygon foundations**: Start with vertices of regular polygons and perturb systematically
- **Multi-scale approaches**: 
  * Coarse grid initialization followed by continuous optimization
  * Hierarchical placement (outer boundary points first, then interior)
- **Adaptive algorithms**: 
  * Simulated annealing with adaptive temperature schedules
  * Differential evolution with self-adaptive parameters (this is our chosen method)
  * Particle swarm optimization with velocity clamping
  * Basin-hopping for escaping local optima
- **Gradient-free methods**: 
  * Nelder-Mead simplex for robust local search
  * Powell's method for coordinate descent
  * COBYLA for constrained optimization without gradients
- **Hybrid optimization**:
  * Genetic algorithms with local refinement operators
  * Memetic algorithms combining global and local search
  * Multiple restart strategies from different initializations
- **Geometric heuristics**:
  * Maximin designs from experimental design theory
  * Voronoi-based adaptive placement
  * Force-directed layouts with repulsive interactions
  
**GEOMETRIC INSIGHTS & MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS (context for the problem):**
- **Packing vs. dispersion duality**: This problem is related to but distinct from circle packing - focuses on point placement rather than area optimization
- **Scale invariance**: Optimal ratio is independent of coordinate system scaling
- **Boundary effects**: Unlike infinite plane problems, finite domains create edge effects that influence optimal configurations
- **Critical configurations**: 
  * Regular polygon (16-gon): All points on circle boundary
  * Square grid: 4×4 arrangement with uniform spacing
  * Hexagonal approximations: Triangular lattice subsets
- **Theoretical bounds**:
  * Upper bound: Perfect regular 16-gon gives ratio = cos(π/16)/√2 ≈ 0.383
  * Lower bound: Random placement typically yields ratios < 0.1
  * AlphaEvolve benchmark: 0.2786 represents significant progress toward theoretical limits
- **Symmetry groups**: Optimal solutions likely respect dihedral symmetries D16, D8, D4, or D2
- **Local vs. global optima**: High-dimensional landscape with many local optima requires sophisticated global optimization

**IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES (specific techniques to use within the chosen framework):**
**Recommended implementation patterns:**
- **Distance computation**: 
  * `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist()` for efficient pairwise distances (crucial for objective function)
  * Vectorized operations using broadcasting for gradient computation (though `differential_evolution` is gradient-free)
- **Optimization frameworks**:
  * `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution()` for global search (our primary tool)
  * Custom objective functions handling min/max ratio computation (as detailed above)
- **Constraint handling**:
  * `differential_evolution` handles bounds directly, which simplifies constraint management for the unit square.
- **Advanced techniques**:
  * Multi-start optimization from diverse initializations (implicitly handled by `differential_evolution`'s population-based approach)
  * Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) (alternative for exploration, but `differential_evolution` is sufficient for this task)
  * Bayesian optimization for expensive function evaluations (not strictly necessary here as `objective` is relatively fast)

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
- **Geometric validation**:
  * Verify exactly 16 distinct points
  * Check coordinate bounds (typically [0,1] × [0,1])
  * Validate distance matrix symmetry and positivity
- **Data validation**:
  * All coordinates must be finite floats
  * No duplicate points (minimum separation threshold)
  * Proper handling of numerical precision issues
- **Solution quality assessment**:
  * Symmetry analysis of final configuration
  * Stability under small perturbations
  * Comparison with known geometric configurations
- **Optimization diagnostics**:
  * Convergence history tracking
  * Gradient norm analysis (when applicable)
  * Multi-run consistency checks
  
PROBLEM-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- **Initialization strategies**:
  * Random uniform placement in unit square
  * Regular polygon vertices with small perturbations
  * Grid-based starting points with jitter
  * Quasi-random sequences (Sobol, Halton) for better space coverage
- **Objective function challenges**:
  * Non-smooth function (min/max operations)
  * Multiple local optima
  * Sensitivity to small coordinate changes
- **Constraint geometry**:
  * Unit square vs. unit circle domains
  * Periodic boundary conditions vs. hard boundaries
  * Allowable vs. required symmetries
