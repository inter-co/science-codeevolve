SETTING:
You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist focusing on point dispersion problems.
Your task is to evolve a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 16 points in 2D space, maximizing the ratio of minimum distance to maximum distance between all point pairs.

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
- Target: Beat the AlphaEvolve benchmark of min/max ratio = 1/√12.889266112 ≈ 0.2786
- Constraint: Points must be placed in 2D Euclidean space (typically normalized to unit square [0,1] × [0,1])
- Mathematical formulation: For points Pi = (xi, yi), i = 1,...,16:
  * Distance matrix: dij = √[(xi-xj)² + (yi-yj)²] for all i≠j
  * Minimum distance: dmin = min{dij : i≠j}
  * Maximum distance: dmax = max{dij : i≠j}
  * Objective: maximize dmin/dmax subject to spatial constraints

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
1. **min_max_ratio**: dmin/dmax ratio (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
2. **benchmark_ratio**: min_max_ratio / 0.2786 (progress toward beating AlphaEvolve benchmark)
3. **eval_time**: Execution time in seconds (balance accuracy vs. efficiency)

COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES:
**Core packages**: numpy, scipy, sympy, pandas
**Additional useful packages**:

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES TO CONSIDER:
Given the non-convex and high-dimensional nature of this global optimization problem (32 variables for 16 points in 2D), metaheuristic algorithms are highly recommended.
*   **Differential Evolution (`scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`)**: This algorithm is robust for global optimization over a bounded parameter space and is often a good first choice for problems with many local optima. It inherently handles bounds.
*   **Basin Hopping (`scipy.optimize.basinhopping`)**: Combines global "hops" with local minimization steps, effective for exploring rugged landscapes and escaping local minima.
*   **Objective Function Formulation**: The problem is to *maximize* `dmin/dmax`. Optimization algorithms typically *minimize* a function. Therefore, the objective function should return `- (dmin/dmax)`.

GEOMETRIC INSIGHTS & MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS:
*   **Point Dispersion Problems**: This is a classic point dispersion problem, related to distributing points "as evenly as possible" within a given domain.
*   **Relation to Sphere/Circle Packing**: In 2D, the problem has connections to circle packing. Optimal local arrangements often exhibit hexagonal packing symmetries, even within a square boundary.
*   **Boundary Effects**: Points near the edges or corners of the unit square will have different neighborhood structures compared to interior points, which can influence the optimal arrangement. The `dmax` is often determined by points on the diagonal.
*   **Optimal Configurations**: For small N, optimal configurations often possess high symmetry. For N=16, expect a structured, non-random pattern.

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
1.  **Objective Function**: Define a function that takes a flattened 1D numpy array of point coordinates (e.g., `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., x16, y16]`) as input.
    *   Inside this function, reshape the input array back into a `(16, 2)` array of points.
    *   Calculate pairwise Euclidean distances using `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`.
    *   Determine `dmin` and `dmax` from these distances.
    *   Return `- (dmin / dmax)` to convert it into a minimization problem. Handle the `dmax = 0` case by returning a very small negative number or `np.inf` if appropriate, though a well-initialized optimizer should avoid this.
2.  **Bounds**: All point coordinates `x_i` and `y_i` must be within `[0, 1]`. The optimization function should specify these bounds explicitly. For `differential_evolution`, this will be a list of `(min, max)` tuples for each coordinate: `[(0, 1), (0, 1), ..., (0, 1)]` for all 32 coordinates.
3.  **Optimizer Choice**: Use `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`.
    *   Pass the objective function, the bounds, and the `seed=42` for reproducibility.
    *   Consider tuning `popsize` and `maxiter` to balance computation time and solution quality. A larger `popsize` and `maxiter` will generally lead to better results but take longer.
4.  **Initial Population**: `differential_evolution` can generate its own initial population within the bounds. No need for explicit initialization unless specific heuristics are desired.
5.  **Output**: The function should return a `np.ndarray` of shape `(16, 2)` containing the optimized point coordinates.

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
1.  **Min/Max Ratio Calculation**: Implement a helper function to calculate `dmin/dmax` from a `(N, 2)` array of points. This function should use `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` and `np.min`/`np.max`.
2.  **Boundary Check**: Ensure that all optimized `x` and `y` coordinates are strictly within the `[0, 1]` range (or very close due to floating-point precision).
3.  **Reproducibility**: Double-check that `seed=42` is correctly applied to the optimizer to ensure consistent results across runs.

PROBLEM-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
*   **Computational Cost vs. Accuracy**: Finding the absolute global optimum for N=16 is challenging. The `eval_time` constraint implies that the optimization parameters (e.g., `maxiter`, `popsize` in `differential_evolution`) should be chosen carefully to allow for a reasonable number of iterations without exceeding the time limit.
*   **Local Optima**: The problem landscape is known to have many local optima. `differential_evolution` is designed to mitigate this, but multiple runs with different seeds or slight parameter variations might yield even better results if time permits (though the function should be self-contained).
*   **Benchmark Context**: The AlphaEvolve benchmark suggests that evolutionary algorithms are a strong approach. The chosen `scipy.optimize` methods (like Differential Evolution) fall into this category.
