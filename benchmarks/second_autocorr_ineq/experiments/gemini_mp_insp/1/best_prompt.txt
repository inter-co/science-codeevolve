MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM CONTEXT:
**Core Problem**: Find a non-negative function f: ℝ → ℝ that maximizes the constant C₂ in the second autocorrelation inequality:
||f ★ f||₂² ≤ C₂ ||f ★ f||₁ ||f ★ f||_{∞}

**Mathematical Framework**:
- Objective: Maximize C₂ = ||f ★ f||₂² / (||f ★ f||₁ ||f ★ f||_{∞})

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS:
The second autocorrelation inequality constant C₂ is invariant under scaling of f (i.e., C₂(cf) = C₂(f) for c > 0) and translation of f (i.e., C₂(f(x-a)) = C₂(f(x))). This allows for significant simplifications.

1.  **Normalization**: Without loss of generality, we can normalize the function `f` such that its integral is 1: `∫f(x) dx = 1`. This is a crucial step that simplifies the denominator term `||f ★ f||₁`.
    *   Since `f(x) ≥ 0`, its convolution `(f ★ f)(x)` is also non-negative.
    *   A key property of convolution is `∫(f ★ f)(x) dx = (∫f(x) dx)²`.
    *   Therefore, with the normalization `∫f = 1`, we have `||f ★ f||₁ = 1`.
    *   The objective function simplifies to: **Maximize C₂ = ||f ★ f||₂² / ||f ★ f||_{∞}**.

2.  **Domain**: Assume `f` is supported on a finite interval, e.g., `[0, L]` for some `L > 0`. A common and convenient choice is `L=1`. Consequently, its autocorrelation `g = f ★ f` will be supported on `[0, 2L]`.

3.  **Known Candidates**: The current best known lower bound for C₂ (approximately 0.89628) is achieved by a characteristic function (indicator function) of two disjoint intervals. This suggests that piecewise constant functions, or functions with sharp transitions, are strong candidates.

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES TO CONSIDER:
Given the non-convex nature of the problem and the insights from known optimal functions, consider the following:

1.  **Parametric Function Representation**: Instead of optimizing discrete `f_values` directly, optimize the parameters of a specific function family for `f`. This can lead to smoother, more structured, and potentially better global solutions.
    *   **Characteristic Functions**: A highly recommended approach is to parameterize `f` as a sum of characteristic functions (indicator functions) of a few disjoint intervals. For example, `f(x) = A₁ * I_{[a₁, b₁]}(x) + A₂ * I_{[a₂, b₂]}(x) + ...`.
        *   Optimize the interval endpoints (`aᵢ`, `bᵢ`) and amplitudes (`Aᵢ`).
        *   Enforce `Aᵢ ≥ 0` and `aᵢ < bᵢ`.
        *   The normalization `∫f = 1` must be explicitly handled. For instance, after computing `f(x)` from parameters and discretizing it, scale the discretized values by `1 / (∫f(x) dx)` before proceeding with convolution.

2.  **Discretization**: When using parametric functions, discretize the function `f` and its convolution `f ★ f` on a sufficiently fine and consistent grid to accurately compute the norms.

3.  **Handling Non-convexity**:
    *   **Multiple Restarts**: Since the objective function is non-convex, perform optimization from multiple random initial parameter guesses to explore the search space and find better local optima.
    *   **Evolutionary Algorithms**: For complex parameterizations, consider algorithms like differential evolution or genetic algorithms (e.g., using `pymoo`) which are less prone to local optima.

**Recommended implementation patterns**:
1.  **JAX for Autodiff**: Continue to leverage JAX for automatic differentiation, which is crucial for gradient-based optimization of complex objectives.
2.  **FFT for Convolution**: Efficiently compute `g = f ★ f` using `jax.numpy.fft.fft` and `jax.numpy.fft.ifft`. Ensure proper zero-padding (e.g., to the next power of 2, or to `2*N` if `f` has `N` points) to avoid circular convolution artifacts and ensure accurate representation of `g` on its domain `[0, 2L]`.
3.  **Numerical Integration for Norms**:
    *   **Consistent Discretization**: Choose a domain length `L` (e.g., `L=1.0`) and a number of discretization points `N` for `f`. This defines the grid for `f` (e.g., `x_f = jnp.linspace(0, L, N, endpoint=False)`). The grid spacing for `f` is `h_f = L / N`.
    *   **Normalized `f`**: Before computing the convolution, ensure `∫f dx = 1`. This means calculating `integral_f = jnp.sum(f_values) * h_f` (using trapezoidal rule for `f_values`). Then, scale `f_values = f_values / integral_f`.
    *   **Convolution Grid**: The convolution `g = f ★ f` will be defined on `[0, 2L]`. If `f` has `N` points on `[0, L]`, the convolution will typically have `2N-1` or `2N` non-zero points after FFT. Let `M` be the number of points in the resulting convolution array. The grid spacing for `g` is `h_g = 2L / M`.
    *   **L2 Norm**: Compute `||g||₂² = ∫|g(x)|² dx`. Use a robust numerical integration scheme (e.g., trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule) with the correct `h_g` factor. For instance, `jnp.sum(g_values**2) * h_g`.
    *   **L-infinity Norm**: Compute `||g||_{∞} = sup|g(x)|` as `jax.numpy.max(jax.numpy.abs(g_values))`.
    *   **L1 Norm**: As derived from the normalization `∫f = 1`, the term `||f ★ f||₁` is exactly `1`. This term should *not* be numerically integrated from `g_values` in the objective function.
4.  **Enforcing `f(x) ≥ 0`**: This constraint is critical. If `f` is parameterized, ensure its definition or a `jax.nn.relu` operation on its values maintains non-negativity.
5.  **Reproducibility**: Strictly adhere to fixed random seeds for all stochastic components (`jax.random.PRNGKey(42)`, `numpy.random.seed(42)`).
